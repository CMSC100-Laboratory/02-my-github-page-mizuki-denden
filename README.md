## What are your key takeaways from this exercise?
    From this exercise I learned how to use basic HTML tags, attributes, and elements. 
    I also had an understanding how stylesheets, specifically, CSS, works.
    I realized that CSS gives life to a website. Even if a web is working if its interface is dead, then the web will look dead as well.
