                    <h3>Digital Friend Slambook</h3>
                    <p>This Digital SlamBook is a mobile application that allows users to create a personalized profile and get to know friends easily. 
                      Users can add friends by scanning a QR code, edit friend details, and update their own profile information. 
                      It also lets them upload an image for their friend and profile photo.
                      The app features a signin and signup verification to have distinguishable user accounts. This app uses firebase and firestore to save the information
                      that has been input on each profile.

                    <h3>Profile Page Creation</h3>
                    <p>This project involves creating a simple profile page of a favorite character.  The page has a header with an “Add Bio” button (non-functional), 
                      an engagement counter to display the number of posts, and clickable tabs for Posts, Reels, Saved, and Tagged. 
                      The posts section displays a minimum of 4 posts initially, with a grid layout having 3 posts per block. 
                      A floating action button is also included to be able to add a new post. 
                      The design focuses on abstraction and proper componentization of widgets for maintainability and scalability.</p>

                    <h3>Add and Delete a Contact</h3>
                    <p>In this project, the flutter_contacts package was used to implement Add and Delete features in a Contacts app. 
                      The contact form lets the user input a first name and phone number, while the last name and email address are optional fields. 
                      Additionally, users can upload a profile picture, which will be displayed in the app.
                      Any changes made in the app, such as adding or deleting contacts, is reflected in the phone's native contacts app and vice versa. 
                      For implementation, follow the documentation for the flutter_contacts package to handle these functionalities properly. 
                      The code focuses on abstraction and widget componentization.</p>
